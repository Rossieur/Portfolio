                    This was the prototype for the game's design. It was drawn and written by one of tbe other group members, and we all contributed our ideas for the game's structure, story, and design.

                    This was the poster we made as a group for an assignment. We had to present it as an outline for the game's structure, story, and design. The background was painted and outline description printed by the same group member that drew the prototype, each planet was drawn by a different group member with mine being Mindurk, along with its only inhabitants, the Corturk, and it's "cookie" moon.
